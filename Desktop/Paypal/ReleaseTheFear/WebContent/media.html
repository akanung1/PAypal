Please allow me to share some of our accomplishments: <br>
In 2005 Release the Fear and the Arizona Community unveiled a sculpture as a 
tangible reminder to the core of our mission, believing that all perceived 
negatives can be transformed into a positive life experience, as displayed in 
the sculpture titled &quot;Release the Fear.&quot; This 17,000 pound sculpture, 
incorporating four tons of melted-down weapons previously used in violent 
crimes, emerging 25 foot in the middle of Central Avenue in Phoenix, AZ. is the 
visual symbol that impacting countless viewers as a reminder that anything is 
possible.<ul type="square">

<p><b>Rebuilding young lives through art and self-esteem</b><br>
Thursday, March 14, 2013 8:58 am<br>
By BILL COATES, Valley Life Editor</p>
<p>More than two dozen teens gathered in a small classroom at First Presbyterian 
Church on Cottonwood Lane. This wasn&#8217;t Bible class. They were here to learn 
about themselves through art and communication.<br>
<br>
Phoenix artist Robert Miley led the session. He started by asking all the teens 
to introduce themselves and name one thing they liked about themselves. So it 
was that the session began on a positive note. And building a positive 
self-image is a big part of the three-day workshop, known as Release the Fear.<br>
<br>
One young man, braided locks flowing over his shoulder, said: &#8220;I like my hair.&#8221; 
Another said, &#8220;I&#8217;m awesome.&#8221; Then, &#8220;My name&#8217;s Cynthia, I&#8217;m nice.&#8221;<br>

Though completed in 2005, a sculpture in downtown Phoenix is garnering attention 
again because of a reignited gun-control debate.<p>Towering at 24 feet, &#8220;Release 
the Fear&#8221; is made from 4 tons of melted weapons including handguns, machine 
guns, knives, nunchaku, chains and a samurai sword.<p>The weapons were all 
confiscated by local law-enforcement officials and donated to the project. Some 
are visible in the base, their mangled metal transforming into a human figure 
reaching up to the sky.<p>&#8220;It took a while to collect them; there was some 
opposition,&#8221; said Robert Miley, the Phoenix-based artist behind the project.<p>
It took him 10 years to complete the sculpture because of hurdles from local 
developers, City Council members, funding problems and light-rail plans, he 
said. And the National Rifle Association, after many conversations, agreed not 
to oppose the project even though their bylaws discourage the melting down of 
guns.<p>Weapons were donated from all over the Valley.<p>The city of Glendale 
provided confiscated knives, Miley said. One precinct in south Phoenix collected 
more than 600 weapons in one month.<p>The Arizona Department of Public Safety 
chopped them up for melting.<p>Today the sculpture stands at Roosevelt Street 
and Central Avenue, at the Metro light-rail stop. It&#8217;s surrounded by four 
concrete panels sandblasted with the names of people and organizations who 
helped make it happen.<p>The sculpture&#8217;s outstretched arms are symbolic of the 
ability to transform by being freed of fear, Miley said, much like the kids he 
works with every day through the Release the Fear organization.<p>&#8220;Hopefully, 
(the sculpture) ... helps community members relieve some of the fear in their 
life, that baggage that we&#8217;re carrying around,&#8221; he said.<hr>
<p>About Release 
the Fear and the important work that they do.<p>&#8220;The 
Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections (ADJC) has a longstanding and 
positive working relationship with Release the Fear. The youth adjudicated to us 
often have a range of issues to address, including delinquency, substance abuse 
and dependence, mental health, and trauma. Release the Fear workshops, held at 
ADJC several times per year, provide a safe place where the youth can be honest 
and open about their behavioral problems. The workshops take place over a number 
of days and a large number of youth have been served for several years through 
this program. Dedicated facilitators assist youth in developing the life skills 
needed to address the life issues they face, including peer pressure, gang 
involvement, bullying, abuse, and violence. The value of this powerful program 
is that it reinforces, in a relaxed and non-judgmental fashion, the treatment 
interventions that our youth receive while they are with us in secure care. 
Consequently, all interventions, including those provided by Release the Fear, 
add to a youth&#8217;s ability to successfully transition to the community with 
transferable skills. ADJC is appreciative of this program and hope that our 
youth continue to benefit from the workshops.&#8221;<p>

<b>At Breakfast in the Community Center, Fry&#8217;s Mercado Tuesday, October 19, 
2010</b> <br>
The keynote speaker U.S. Marshall David Gonzales spoke about the importance of 
Release the Fear. He said, &#8220;Yesterday I had to write a check for $14,000,000 for 
one month of the costs to house just our Federal Prisoners at a facility in 
Florence, AZ. It hurts me to write that check especially when I think about all 
the good that money could be doing towards education and programs like Release 
the Fear.&#8221; </p>
<p>US Marshall Gonzales is an Advisory Board Member of RTF, and is passionate 
about the value of early intervention with youth in juvenile detention and the 
positive economic impact such interventions have on the community.</p>

<br />
WHY:<br />
RELEASE THE FEAR ONCE AGAIN, BRING COMMUNITY TOGETHER<br />
<br />
Release the Fear (RTF) a social service agency that offers multi-disciplinary 
experiential base learning workshop programs for youth, engages participants in 
communication and life skill interactive exercises. </p>
<p>
At the conclusion of workshops participants express together on a single canvas 
what they&#8217;ve learned about their newfound possibilities and purpose and what 
they can accomplish together.</p>
<p>
RTF&#8217;s mission is to counter the effects of violence in our communities by 
turning fear, anger, and hate into acceptance, hope, and empowerment by bridging 
endless possibilities through the creative process. <br />
<br />
<br />
Founded in 1996, RTF centers on bringing community together to resolving 
conflict through education and the power of interactive creative processing. 
Adults and children invest time to create an empathetic learning environment to 
raise awareness of their own attitudes. This awakening of self-awareness enables 
children&nbsp;
and adults alike to learn to express themselves and creatively cope with the 
challenges in their lives.</p>
<p>
The educational workshops are ongoing, meeting many Arizona State educational 
standards by utilizing various disciplines such as writing, interactive play, 
and sensory exercises as well as painting and drawing - tangible inquiry tool 
used in the creative context of the programs, showing how creativity is the 
bridge that allows us to pass through fear by giving us a means to explore and 
express the endless possibilities of who and where we are, exposing our true 
purpose in life. For more information visit us on line www.releasethefear.org<br />
