                        initial mood, he evolvedraising his hand to answer questions and eventually 
                        leading a group. At the end of the workshop, facilitators gave each child a 
                        certificate of participation. When it was this boys turn, he stood up and 
                        walked to the facilitator to receive his certificate. </font>

                        he took his certificate, this boy said, <i>I matter.</i> (Matt, age 15)</font>
