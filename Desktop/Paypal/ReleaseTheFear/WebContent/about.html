combat the effects of <b>peer pressure, gang involvement, bullying, abuse</b>, 
and <b>violence</b> in our society. <b>Inspiring</b> and <b>empowering </b>youth 
with the tools to make better life choices, Release the Fear (RTF) has worked 
with thousands of at-risk youth and adults in Arizona and around the world, 
offering experiential programs that help reverse the paralyzing effects of fear 
and diminished self-worth. Our programs encourage youth to explore safe and 
healthy lifestyles and to overcome disabilities through the development of 
leadership and social skills through evidence-based curriculum that meets 
National Common Core standards. Release the Fear, Inc. has worked with youth in 
Arizona, nationally, and internationally, in such places as Guam and El 
Salvador, instilling positive life changes for thousands.</p><p><span class="m">

These programs stimulate whole-brain thinking and develop metacognitive-thought 
processing by utilizing new applied-knowledge teaching methods. These programs 
demonstrate options that awaken a creative consciousness and expose the 
unlimited potential of critical thinking and problem solving to help 
participants <b>develop better cognitive behavioral skills</b>. Our trained 
facilitators guide participants through interactive creative activities and 
analytically explore the connectedness to their lives. Release the Fear utilizes 
inquiry-based-learning experiences, an educational practice where the 
facilitator uses controlled questioning to serve as a learning guide in order to 
move students toward new understandings. Educational research shows that student 
retention increases when new learning is discovered through inquiry practices as 
the student is able to take ownership of new findings. The facilitator must act 
as guide while being an expert questioner, thinking of the end objective at all 
times and posing questions to allow students to reach objectives on their own. 
When this is done, students are able to create new thought patterns that connect 
and build on their applied knowledge and personal life goals. Without these 
essential life skills, the still-maturing minds of school students and detained 
youth view their futures as bleak, with no hope for a &#8220;normal&#8221; life. </p><p><span class="a">
<font color="#7C9745">A</font></span><b>pproach</b>: At the onset of setting up 
the program, students create the expectations for the workshop as a group. 
Facilitators guide them through inquiry based learning skills, to create a safe 
space while empowering and embracing their ability to make constructive and 
respectful choices about personal behavior and social interaction. Based on 
awareness of ethical standards and social norms, of the consequences in their 
actions, and of the well-being of self and others. They, as a group, set up 
guidelines and choose consequences as a way of controlling impulses and a means 
of motivating themselves, creating an environment for achieving personal and 
academic goals while empowering a sense of confidence and optimism. Through 
these experiential programs, we encourage participants to develop valuable core 
life skills, better critical problem solving, and a healthy sense of 
understanding of self and others. Through RTF programs, <b>participants discover 
that anything is possible and that they have a purpose in life. They see why 
they do matter&#8212;to the world, to the community, and most of all to themselves.</b></p><p><span class="t">T</span><b>ransformation</b>: 
Through one of many quantitative studies, Maricopa County Juvenile Probation 
Office released a 2010 report demonstrating the value of Inside-Out Bridging 
PossibilitiesÂ© workshops on <b>357</b> of their juvenile population. Thirty 
percent of incarcerated youth recidivate&#8212;meaning three out of ten will again 
find themselves in conflict with law and society and back behind bars. For the 
incarcerated youth who participated in just <b>one Release the Fear workshop</b>, 
that <b>recidivism figure dropped to 23 percent</b>. For those who were able to 
benefit from <b>multiple workshops</b>, it dropped to <b>16 percent&#8212;nearly half</b>. 
That is an impressive impact on any child&#8217;s future as well as the community in 
general.</p><p><b>TURNING PAIN INTO POSSIBILITIES, POSSIBILITIES INTO PURPOSE</b> <b><font color="#FE0000">.</font> <font color="#008000">.</font> <font color="#800080">.</font></b> <b>OPENING

		with the tools to overcome the paralyzing affects of fear and violence,

		because &#8220;They Matter.&#8221;</p>
		<p>Founded in 1996, Release the Fear, a health and human services 
		agency, exists to counter the effects of violence in our communities by 
		turning fear, anger, and hate into acceptance,hope,and self-empowerment 
		by bridging endless possibilities through the creative process. The 
		community we serve is comprised mainly of minority children, children 
		whose lives are dictated by the pathological issues they face on a daily 
		basis. </p>
		<p>In 2005, RTF unveiled a 25-foot, 4 ton sculpture in downtown Phoenix 
		that was created from melted down weapons, previously used in violent 
		crimes. This symbol of releasing fear is a reminder of our core vision: 
		that what was once perceived to be negative can be transformed into a 
		positive. </p>
		<p>Summer of 2005, the education component effort was developed and 
		launched in schools and community centers, and is now RTF&#8217;s core focus. 
		In 2005, we received a National Endowment Grant to work with youth in 
		two detention centers in Maricopa County to instill in them, the hope of 
		achieving their dreams.</p>
		<p>Since 2005, through workshops RTF has taught valuable life skills, 
		enhanced participant&#8217;s self-awareness, and allowed participants to 
		experience alternative ways of dealing with conflict and anger.</p>
		<p>Teaching troubled kids, in jails, detention, treatment centers and 
		schools, as prevention. Through the creative processes of Art, Music and 
		Communication, we teach kids cognitive behavioral skills to build 
		self-esteem. They Learn tools that help them with school work and with 
		conflict resolution, peer pressure, bullying </p>
		<p>RTF&#8217;s goal is to present workshops designed to alter possible violent 
		behaviors and perceptions in participants through education, risk 
		reduction, and the use of the Stages of Change Behavioral Health model. 
		The workshop curriculum meets Arizona State and Common Core National 
		Education Standards, including College Prep. </p>
		<p><span class="m">O</span>ver six thousand youth worldwide have benefited from Release the 
		Fear&#8217;s programs. In the past two years more than 1,500 Arizona youth 
		have participated in at least one of RTF&#8217;s six programs that use 
		self-exploration as a peaceful alternative to violence. Our facilitators 
		guide participants through interactive creative activities to 
		analytically explore the connectedness of those activities to their 
		lives.</p>
		<p><b>MISSION:</b> To counter the effects of violence in our communities 
		by turning fear, anger, and hate into acceptance, hope, and self 
		empowerment by bridging endless possibilities through the creative

		<b>Inside-Out Bridging Possibilities</b> program, launched in the summer

		three-day workshop, drawing from their experiences in the program, 
		participants create a group painting to present to the public. This

		<p><b>DISCOVER U = After School </b>is a desperately needed program for 
		our at-risk youth. It will expose them to ways, new to them, to deal 
		with life's challenges in school and community. We witnessed results 
		nothing less than incredible in our Discover U Summer Camp youth. 
		Knowing this, RTF made a conscious decision to design DISCOVER U = After 
		School and integrate this curriculum throughout the school year, 
		offering it to many school districts as an after school program. We must 
		stimulate as many young minds, bodies, and spirits as possible, by 
		exposing them to meaningful activities while inspiring and empowering 
		them with the tools to make better life choices. We provide the 
		educational resources so that these youth learn how to determine what

		school.</p>
