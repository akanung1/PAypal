  <p class="read-more-wrap"><b>"Release the Fear" Program Results: </b><span class="read-more-target">Quantitative Evidence: The Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections (ADJC) followed a three-year longitudinal study on 928 ADJC juveniles who attended one of more RTF Inside Out Bridging Possibilities programs between 2012 and 2015. The results demonstrate the RTF program is helping to reduce recidivism from 43 percent (the ADJC recidivism average) to 32 percent. 
A separate report by the Maricopa County Juvenile Probation Office released a 2010 report demonstrating the value of Release the Fears Inside-Out Bridging Possibilities workshops on 357 individuals in their juvenile population. The report said that 30 percent of incarcerated/detained youth recidivate. For the incarcerated youth who participated in one RTF workshop, that recidivism figure dropped to 23 percent. For those who were able to benefit from multiple workshops, it dropped to 16 percent  nearly half of their 30 percent average. 
Another huge reason we do what we do is to continue to hear success stories such as these: <br>



Qualitative Evidence: I never thought that Id come this far. I always thought that Id be forever stuck in a downward spiral, trying to commit suicide, and being a brick wall. I finally came to Florence Crittenton, where I was helped by a Release the Fear program that helped me by showing me that I am much more than an individual. I am someone. I am great, powerful, loved, amazing, worthy, and a leader. I am me. And theres so much more to me than just my past. I am very thankful for everyone that helped me get this far. I have spoken in front of more than 800 people, and told my story. I am grateful for all the things that I get to do. I am currently in 10th grade, and in a dual enrolment class getting 3 full college credits. I am planning on becoming a biophysicist. I plan on helping people, and I look forward to being the change I wish to see in the world. Shelly  17 
"This experience helped me open my eyes and realize all the many opportunities Ive been ignoring all along. I also learned to express your feelings to others to understand and relate to others emotions. The Hopes and Dreams activity taught me that in order to reach your dreams, you must overcome difficult obstacles. Tyrone-15 <br>

We will continue reaching out to underserved communities, helping them turn their Pain into Possibilities, so they are able to find their Purpose in a more meaningful productive life, for a brighter tomorrow.

<p><span class="m">D</span><b>escription of the program, including the goals, expected outcome:</b> </p>
<p>Between Pre &amp; Post surveys the participants engage in team reflective surveys, 
after each exercise. Where they take turns being a team leader and are 
responsible for extracting inquiry from their team and reporting to the entire 
group their findings. How would this activity help you in your day life in 
school or out, and why?&nbsp; At the end 
of the 3-day workshop, as the culmination and pinnacle of their experiences 
drawn from the program, participants create a group painting to present to the 
public; an expression created by persons from multiple perspectives can be 
harmonious and unifying. Thus, this is not only a healing experience for the 
group but also a community awareness campaign, sharing a message of decreased 
violence of all types. Our findings from Pre &amp; Post results, majority realize 
that they are not alone in their fears and that their dreams can become reality. 
By introducing new and fresh perspectives through the power of the creative 
process, our participants learn to embrace life and fully realize its endless 
possibilities. Shifting awareness turns Pain into the means of Bridging their 
Possibilities, so participants can become enlightened about their Purpose and 
lead a productive life.</p>
<p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC">Mikayla&#8217;s story is one of many successes to 
create a &#8220;rippling effect&#8221; through RTF: &#8220;I was into drugs, and into gangs. I was 
on a destructive path and didn&#8217;t care--about anything. I happened to be in the 
class when Release the Fear was presented, only because I needed the credit. I 
didn&#8217;t want to be there. In fact, when I first met Robert and RJ, I didn&#8217;t like 
them. I didn&#8217;t like what they were saying. I didn&#8217;t like the program. I didn&#8217;t 
want to have anything to do with any of it. But a few days later, those feelings 
began to change. It was like my eyes were taken out. And the program gave me new 
eyes--eyes that allowed me to see the world in a different way. And I began to 
imagine a person I might be. If I had not taken the Release the Fear workshop, I 
would be in jail today, or worse. Instead, I just graduated with my Bachelors&#8217; 
degree in Science. Thanks to this program&#8221;. <br />
<br />
Mikayla has been identified as becoming one of Release the Fear new program 
trainers in 2009.</font></p>
<p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC">&#8220;When I arrived at this class I did not think 
much of art. As the days went by I started to realize that this group was not 
just about art, it was about learning about yourself. This group has helped me 
look inside my heart and mind to see the answers to life&#8217;s questions. It was an 
awesome experience being here and it has impacted the entire way I see life. 
This group can be helpful to not only teens across the world but many adults as 
well. Thank you Robert for taking time out of your life to help teach people how 
to come in contact with their inner selves.&#8221; <br>

the way of their Dreams, because they are just speed bumps, not road blocks.&#8221; 
James age 17</font></p>
<p><span>A</span> therapist recently approached me at one of the juvenile 
detention facilities, saying that she had several clients who had gone through 
the RTF workshop. She said that she was amazed at what we were accomplishing in 
three days work and just had to see what we were doing first hand. &#8220;I met with 
these kids, two days before they participated in the RTF workshop,&#8221; she shared. 
&#8220;And then I met with them one day after that workshop. The transformation was 
incredible. Your Program did what I been trying to do for two years.&#8221; I replied 
to her that RTF &#8220;shakes up the snow globe,&#8221; enabling these youth to move 
forward, and that we all work together in rescuing these youth from a 
crime-filled life. The releasing of fear is truly a partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the seminars something happens for the participants, which leads them to 
move forward from living in their own personal world to sharing a world and 
their views with others.&#8221; </p>
<p>There are no other programs with similar methodology of teaching valuable life 
skills, enhance participants&#8217; sense of self and surroundings, and allow them to 
experience alternative ways of dealing with conflict and anger.</p>
<p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC">Release the Fear is about unblocking previous 
personal barriers and becoming open for new possibilities, ones which have not 
been possible in the past. Participants gain new tools from RTF insights and as 
a result enter their future from a different perspective. As the participants 
move through the seminar, a release of energy occurs. From my experiences there 
is a heaviness lifted off from many. The kids seem to move from understanding 
their world as an individual to becoming part of a group of their peers. RTF is 
different than a typical therapeutic setting. The exercises of RTF walk the 
students through their personal world and lead them to distinguish insights as 
only they would understand. This is where the release occurs. The kids share 
their insights and become the stimulus for change for themselves and the others 
in the group. Participants leave RTF as different individuals then when they had 
entered. <br />

<p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC">&#8220;Art is a great tool in controlling anger and

&#8220;We had a detainee that was very quiet and reserved. He was also on suicide 
watch. I didn&#8217;t believe he was going to complete the first day. After the first 
project he became more engaged and more self-confident. As the program went on 
he became more assertive and comfortable in expressing himself. This is an 
excellent program for the kids. It allows them to express themselves, to become 
more self-confident.&#8221;<br />

<p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC">&quot;This expresses our support and interest in 
working with Release the Fear (RTF) on the Bridging Possibilities project for 
participants at the Durango and Mesa SEF Juvenile Detention Centers. We have 
been impressed with the work of RTF in the past, as our youth are taught new 
ways of dealing with conflict and anger &#8211; healthy ways of expressing themselves 
such that they do not re-offend, and can lead productive lives, contributing to 
their communities. Through the creative process, our youth have seen that art 
can be wonderful tool for them, and they have gained a better understanding of 
themselves and their peers. We are eager to continue work with RTF so that our 
youth can turn their pain into possibilities and purpose!&quot; <br />

<p><b>Program Narrative quantitative measures:</b></p>
<p>Release the Fear (RTF) feels the 4 most important outputs listed below 
reflect the shift and changes that participants experience due to the workshops. 
The reason why we think these are important to these children&#8217;s future; The 
average curriculum time that participants engage in is approx. 2 hrs/day, in the 
case of Inside Out - Bridging Possibilities Workshops, (IO-BP) over 3 days. With 
take away reflective assignments given to participants to enable them to engage 
life outside of workshop and share its relevance with each other. As seen listed 
below in track record and the growth of RTF&#8217;s audience. Why is this important? 
Scientific studies prove that children are incapable of learning, let alone 
retaining, any new knowledge given to them if they are in an environment which 
presents itself as frightening. A student must first know that they are in an 
atmosphere of support and caring before they can begin to take in any new 
concepts, context and knowledge. To be complacent about our future, our goals, 
and our dreams makes us complacent about our present, for the present is the 
stepping stone of all that is to come. That first step gives the hope and 
courage to believe that our dreams, our goals are possible. Children must have 
the courage and wisdom instilled in them to take that first step. After that 
they become one measure closer to what will fill them with utter joy, pride and 
self worth. </p>
<p><span>O</span>ur programs provide and demonstrate endless possibilities and options for the 
individual through the experiential creative process of whole-brain thinking. 
This awakens a creative consciousness and exposes the individual to the 
unlimited potential of critical thinking, problem solving, and self-empowerment, 
awakening the individual to new possibilities and a new purpose that leads to 
improved life skills and becoming a productive community member. Without these 
critical life skills, the still-maturing minds of detained youth view their 
future as bleak and set in stone with no hope for a &#8220;normal&#8221; life.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 youth worldwide have benefited from Release the Fear&#8217;s 
	programs. In the past two years more than 800 Arizona youth have 
	participated in one of RTF&#8217;s four programs that use self-exploration as a 
	peaceful alternative to violence. Our facilitators guide participants 
	through interactive creative activities to analytically explore the 
	connectedness of those activities to their lives.</p>

<b>Second Chance Transition</b> program, launched in the fall of 2012, works 
with Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections Paroled staff and community 
centers, as youth transition out of secure care (behind the fence) back into the 
community.<br>
<br>
<b>Dream Catcher </b>program launched in September 2009. Fry&#8217;s Food Stores is 
the first community partnership to support this youth/adult mentor program that 
captures the dreams revealed through RTF workshops and embraces them so that 
they may become a reality. After exploring their dreams in the workshop, RTF 
staff places the participant with an adult community member who is working in 
the participant&#8217;s desired career. The youth shadows the mentor for a day or for 
the duration of a project.<b><a title="Click here for more" href="workshops_dreamcatcher.asp">Click here for

A past participant in the Inside-Out Bridging Possibilities workshop states:<br>
&#8220;When I arrived at this class I did not think much of art. As the days went by I 
started to realize that this group was not just about art, it was about learning 
about yourself. This group has helped me look inside my heart and mind to see 
the answers to life&#8217;s questions. It was an awesome experience being here and it 
has impacted the entire way I see life. This group can be helpful to not only 
teens across the world but many adults as well. Thank you Robert for taking time 
out of your life to help teach people how to come in contact with their inner 
selves.&#8221;&nbsp; Sincerely, Jana B.</p>

<p>The above graph was provided by Maricopa County statistics office, and 
reflect youth Not Recidivating. The effectiveness of Release the Fear&#8217;s 
workshops on the reduction of recidivism rate for the period of March 2009 thru 
March 2010 ~ 357 youth participated in study<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="images/worksh8.jpg"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="images/worksh5.gif"></p>
<p><br>
Statistics from Maricopa County&#8217;s Juvenile Probation Department demonstrate 
that, while the overall recidivism of incarcerated youth hovers around 30%, <br>
youth participating in one IOBP workshop recidivate only 22.8% of the time, and 
those participating in multiple IOBP workshops recidivate at only 16.2%. <br>
Due to the rippling effects of IOBP and similar workshops, we have learned that 
seven times the number of participants realizes positive impact because of the 
workshops. <br>
